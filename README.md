# MinneapolisVMUGUserCon2019
Everything from my 12:00pm-12:45pm talk on "Legacy Infrastructure Migration to VCSA 6.5/6.7 w/vCommunity PowerCLI Resources."

This will be updated as best as I can muster, with cleaner code and some further explainations.

If you were at the event, feel free to pull and change this as you need.

You'll need to modify it to your liking, so be careful! Enjoy!
